## 🌟 What is AURELION?

AURELION is a **modular cognitive architecture** for personal and organizational knowledge management. It's not a single product - it's a collection of interconnected tools that you can use individually or combine based on your needs.

**The Philosophy:** Start small, add what you need, build your own system.

---

## 🧩 The Modules

Each module is **independent** - use one, some, or all:

## 🎯 Where Should I Start?

### "I need to organize my thoughts"
→ Start with **[KERNEL-Lite](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-kernel-lite)**

Use the 5-floor structure to organize any project, goal, or area of knowledge.

**Then consider:**
- Add **MEMORY** to store your cognitive structures
- Add **ADVISOR** for strategic planning templates

---

### "I want to remember things better"
→ Start with **[MEMORY-Lite](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-memory-lite)**

Build a personal knowledge graph that grows with you.

**Then consider:**
- Add **KERNEL** to structure what you remember
- Add **AGENT** to query your memory with AI

---

### "I'm planning my career/project"
→ Start with **[ADVISOR-Lite](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-advisor-lite)**

Use proven planning methodologies and templates.

**Then consider:**
- Add **KERNEL** to structure your plans
- Add **MEMORY** to track decisions over time
- Add **AGENT** for AI-assisted planning

---

### "I work with AI assistants a lot"
→ Start with **[AGENT-Lite](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-agent-lite)**

Use battle-tested prompts and collaboration protocols.

**Then consider:**
- Add **MEMORY** to persist AI conversations
- Add **ADVISOR** for strategic AI partnerships
- Add **KERNEL** to structure AI outputs

---

### "I'm building a game/simulation/story world"
→ Start with **[NEXUS-Lite](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-nexus-lite)**

Use the simulation framework for NPCs, locations, and events.

**Then consider:**
- Add **MEMORY** to track world state over time
- Add **AGENT** to generate story content with AI

---

## 🔗 Integration Guides

### Using KERNEL + MEMORY Together
[See guide](docs/integration/kernel-memory.md)

Store your cognitive structures in persistent memory. Query them later. Build a external brain that remembers your frameworks.

---

### Using ADVISOR + AGENT Together
[See guide](docs/integration/advisor-agent.md)

Use AI to help you apply planning templates. Strategic Advisor Protocol + Career templates = powerful planning partnership.

---

### Using All 5 Modules: The Full Stack
[See guide](docs/integration/full-stack.md)

How CK built his system piece by piece. How the modules interconnect. Example workflows using everything together.

---

## 📖 CK's Journey

Chase (CK) didn't start with a complete system. He built what he needed, when he needed it:

**Early-2025:** Created KERNEL to organize investigation work across multiple cognitive levels.

**Early-2025:** Added MEMORY when he needed to track knowledge across months of complex cases.

**Late-2025:** Built ADVISOR when planning career transitions and needed strategic frameworks.

**Late-2025:** Developed AGENT when working with AI assistants became a core part of his workflow.

**2026:** Created NEXUS for a D&D campaign (Stonecrest), which evolved into a reusable simulation framework.

**The lesson:** Start where you are. Add what you need. Build your own AURELION system.

## � Licensing Model

### Lite Modules (MIT Licensed)
✅ **Free to clone, use, modify, and distribute**  
✅ All features free to use  
✅ No paid services required  
✅ Available now: KERNEL, MEMORY, ADVISOR, AGENT, NEXUS

### Premium Features (MIT Licensed - Open Source)
✅ **Free to clone, use, modify, and distribute**  
⚠️ Requires paid third-party infrastructure (OpenAI API, Pinecone, vector databases)  
💡 **Premium = open source code + infrastructure costs**  
📅 Coming Q3 2026

### Business Modules (BSL Licensed - 2027+)
✅ **Source available** (can view and modify code)  
⚠️ Commercial use by large organizations requires license  
💡 **Business = multi-user features for enterprise teams**  
📅 Coming 2027+

**TLDR:** All code is free to clone. "Premium" means certain features need paid APIs from OpenAI/Pinecone/etc. "Business" adds multi-user capabilities with different licensing.
