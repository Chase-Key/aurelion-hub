# Contributing to AURELION Hub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AURELION Ecosystem!

## How to Contribute

### Template Contributions (Most Welcome!)

Each Lite module accepts **community-contributed templates**:

**KERNEL-Lite:**
- New cognitive model templates (GTD, PARA, Zettelkasten)
- Project scaffold examples (academic research, creative writing, business analysis)
- Decision framework templates (OODA, ICE scoring, impact/effort matrices)

**ADVISOR-Lite:**
- Career track maps (academic, creative industries, technical leadership)
- Methodology templates (consulting frameworks, research protocols)
- Retrospective guides (sprint retros, project post-mortems, quarterly reviews)

**AGENT-Lite:**
- Collaboration protocol examples (whiteboard sessions, rubber duck debugging)
- Role-based prompts (researcher mode, analyst mode, writer mode)
- Tool-specific guides (Copilot tips, Claude patterns, GPT workflows)

**NEXUS-Lite:**
- Genre world schemas (cyberpunk, space opera, historical, modern)
- Simulation templates (economy rules, political systems, warfare mechanics)
- Character archetype libraries

**Why templates?** They're easy to contribute, immediately useful, and keep Lite tier extensible without code bloat.

### Premium Feature Contributions (Code)

Premium features are also **MIT licensed and open source**. "Premium" refers to features that require paid third-party services (OpenAI API, vector databases, etc.), not closed source code.

You can clone, modify, and contribute to Premium modules freely. The "Premium" label indicates infrastructure requirements, not access restrictions.

For code contributions to Premium modules, see individual module repositories (coming Q3 2026).

### Documentation Improvements

The Hub is primarily documentation. We welcome:
- **Clarifications** - Make explanations clearer
- **Examples** - Add real-world use cases
- **Integration guides** - Show new module combinations
- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step walkthroughs
- **Translations** - Translate docs to other languages

### Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report broken links, unclear documentation, or missing guides
- Be specific about which document needs improvement
- Suggest what would make it better

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b improve-documentation`
3. Make your changes
4. Test that links still work
5. Submit a pull request

### Guidelines

- **Keep it simple** - Clear language over fancy words
- **Show examples** - Code snippets and real use cases
- **Link generously** - Connect related docs
- **Stay modular** - Each guide should be self-contained
