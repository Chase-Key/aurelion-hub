# Using ADVISOR + AGENT Together

**How strategic planning templates meet AI collaboration for powerful planning partnerships**

---

## The Combination

**ADVISOR** provides the structure (planning templates, methodologies).
**AGENT** provides the AI partnership (prompts, collaboration protocols).

**Together:** Use AI to help you apply proven planning frameworks.

---

## Quick Example

### Without Integration

**ADVISOR alone:**
- Read career planning template
- Fill it out manually
- Make decisions alone

**AGENT alone:**
- Ask AI for career advice
- Get generic suggestions
- No structured framework

### With Integration

**ADVISOR + AGENT together:**
```
You (to AI): "Act as my Strategic Advisor. I'm using the Career Transition 
template from ADVISOR-Lite. Let's work through Floor 01 (Current State) together. 
Ask me structured questions to fill out this section."

AI: "I'll help you complete the Current State analysis. Let's start with..."
[Structured conversation using ADVISOR template + AGENT protocol]
```

**Result:** Structured planning + AI intelligence + accountability partnership.

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: AI-Guided Template Completion

Use AGENT prompts to help complete ADVISOR templates.

**Step 1:** Choose ADVISOR template
**Step 2:** Use AGENT Strategic Advisor Protocol
**Step 3:** Work through template sections with AI

**Example:**
```
Template: career_transition_planning.md (ADVISOR)
Protocol: strategic_advisor_protocol.md (AGENT)

Prompt: "I'm completing section 2 of the career transition template 
(Target State Analysis). Act as my strategic advisor and ask probing 
questions to help me articulate my 3-year vision."
```

### Pattern 2: Methodology Application with AI

Use AI to help apply ADVISOR methodologies.

**Example:**
```
Methodology: investigation_framework.md (ADVISOR)
Prompt: "Help me apply the 5-phase investigation framework to my research 
project. I'm in Phase 1 (Scoping). Challenge my assumptions and help me 
define clear boundaries."
```

### Pattern 3: Session Management for Long Planning

Use AGENT session management for multi-week planning work.

**Week 1:**
```
"Starting a 4-week career planning project using ADVISOR templates. 
This is Session 1 of 8. Let's establish context and goals."
```

**Week 4:**
```
"This is Session 8. We've completed Foundation, Systems, and Networks 
floors. Today let's work on Action floor (specific job search steps)."
```

## Real-World Workflows

### Workflow 1: Career Transition Planning

**Time:** 4-6 weeks  
**Modules:** ADVISOR templates + AGENT protocols

**Week 1: Foundation**
- Template: `career_transition_planning.md`
- Prompt: "Strategic Advisor mode. Help me analyze my current skills, values, and constraints."
- Output: Current state documented

**Week 2: Vision**
- Template: `Floor_05_Vision` from KERNEL (if using)
- Prompt: "Challenge my 3-year vision. What am I not considering?"
- Output: Future state clarified

**Week 3: Gap Analysis**
- Template: `gap_analysis.md` (if exists in ADVISOR)
- Prompt: "Help me identify skill gaps between current and target state."
- Output: Learning plan

**Week 4: Action Plan**
- Template: `action_planning.md`
- Prompt: "Help me break down this giant goal into weekly actions."
- Output: 90-day execution plan

**Result:** Structured career transition plan built with AI partnership.

---

### Workflow 2: Strategic Project Planning

**Time:** 2-3 weeks  
**Goal:** Plan a complex project using ADVISOR frameworks + AI assistance

**Session 1: Scoping**
```
Prompt: "This is a 3-session project planning effort. Session 1 goal: 
Define project scope using ADVISOR investigation framework. Ask me the 
questions I need to answer to properly scope this."

AI: [Structured questioning based on framework]
Output: Project scope document
```

**Session 2: Resource Planning**
```
Prompt: "Session 2. We scoped the project last session. Now let's identify 
required resources, timeline, and dependencies. Remind yourself of our scope 
and then help me plan resources."

AI: [Continues from Session 1 context]
Output: Resource and timeline plan
```

**Session 3: Risk Analysis**
```
Prompt: "Final session. Let's do risk analysis and mitigation planning. 
What could go wrong with this project?"

AI: [Risk identification and mitigation strategies]
Output: Risk register
```

---

### Workflow 3: Decision-Making Framework

**Use Case:** Big decision (job offer, career pivot, major investment)

**Step 1: Gather ADVISOR template**
- Use `decision_framework.md` (if exists in ADVISOR)

**Step 2: Apply with AI**
```
Prompt: "I have a major decision to make [describe it]. Act as my Strategic 
Advisor and walk me through a rigorous decision framework. Challenge my 
assumptions and biases."

AI helps you:
- List all options
- Define criteria
- Weight criteria
- Score options
- Identify biases
- Make recommendation
```

**Result:** Documented, defensible decision with AI as thinking partner.

## Example Prompts

### Starting a Planning Session

```
"I'm beginning a strategic planning project using the ADVISOR-Lite career 
planning template. I need you to act as my Strategic Advisor (per AGENT 
Strategic Advisor Protocol). 

Your role:
- Ask probing questions
- Challenge assumptions
- Help me think through 2nd and 3rd order effects
- Keep me accountable to completing each section

Let's start with Section 1: Current State Analysis. 
Ask me 5 strategic questions to help me articulate where I am today."
```

### Mid-Session Continuation

```
"This is Session 3 of our 8-session career planning project. Last sessions 
we completed:
- Session 1: Current state (copied below)
- Session 2: Target state (copied below)

Today's focus: Gap analysis and learning plan. Pick up where we left off."
```

### Wrapping Up

```
"Final session for this planning project. Let's review everything we've 
documented over the past 4 weeks and create:
1. Summary of key decisions
2. 90-day action plan with weekly milestones
3. Accountability checkpoints

Challenge me: What are we missing?"
```

# Strategic Planning Session Template
# Copy this for each session

**Session:** [number] of [total]
**Date:** [date]
**Focus:** [today's topic]

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Structure (ADVISOR)
Don't just ask AI for advice. Choose a template first, THEN apply AI.

### 2. Use Session Management (AGENT)
For multi-week projects, number your sessions and provide context each time.

### 3. Save Outputs
AI conversations disappear. Copy key insights into your project files.

### 4. Iterate in Public
Share your planning documents with AI in future sessions for refinement.

### 5. Challenge Assumptions
Use AI to find blind spots, not just to agree with you.
