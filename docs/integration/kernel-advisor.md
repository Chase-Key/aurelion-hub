# Using KERNEL + ADVISOR Together

**How to use your cognitive foundation as the launchpad for strategic career planning**

---

## The Combination

**KERNEL** provides the foundation (Floor 1 — who you are, what you've done, what you know).
**ADVISOR** provides the strategy (gap analysis, stakeholder mapping, career decisions).

**The gap without integration:** Advisor frameworks feel abstract without grounded, documented current-state data.

**The integration:** KERNEL Floor 1 (Foundation) and Floor 5 (Vision) feed directly into every ADVISOR framework — so your career plans are built on real evidence, not assumptions.

---

## Quick Example

### Without Integration

**ADVISOR alone:**
- Run a gap analysis based on memory and rough estimates
- Stakeholder maps built from scratch each session
- Career decisions made without a documented current-state baseline

**KERNEL alone:**
- Structured templates exist but sit unused
- Floor 1 has career facts but no strategic layer on top of them
- Floor 5 has goals but no path from here to there

### With Integration

**KERNEL + ADVISOR:**
- Floor 1 Career Master → feeds directly into Advisor Gap Analysis (current state is already documented)
- Floor 3 Stakeholder Cards → feeds directly into Advisor Stakeholder Map (relationships already profiled)
- Floor 5 Strategic Goals → feeds directly into Advisor 90-Day Sprint Plan (targets already set)
- Advisor output → saved back into Floor 4 (Action) as a live project file

## Step-by-Step Integration Workflow

### Step 1 — Build Your KERNEL Foundation First

Before running any Advisor framework, complete these three Floor 1 documents:

**Career Master (Floor 1):**
```markdown
## Career Master

**Current Role:** [Title | Company | Start Date]
**Next Target:** [Role | Timeline]

### Skills Inventory
| Skill | Proficiency (1–5) | Evidence | Gap to Target |
|-------|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| Python | 4 | 3 production pipelines | None |
| System Design | 2 | 1 small-scale project | Needs work |

### Career Timeline
- 2022 — Data Analyst at [Company] — Built reporting infrastructure
- 2024 — Senior Analyst — Led QA overhaul for 14 data feeds

### Promotion Criteria (Target Role)
- Required: [list from job description or manager conversation]
- Evidence collected: [what you already have]
- Gap: [what's missing]
```

**Strategic Goal (Floor 5):**
```markdown
## Goal: Senior Data Engineer by Q4 2026

**Horizon:** 12-month
**Why it matters:** Career trajectory + $40k compensation delta

### Success Definition
Promoted or hired into a Senior DE role with system design scope.

### Current Gap (high level)
- System design experience: limited
- Cloud infrastructure exposure: minimal
- Visibility with hiring managers: low
```

### Step 2 — Run the ADVISOR Gap Analysis

With Floor 1 and Floor 5 complete, the Advisor Gap Analysis fills in automatically:

```
Current State (from KERNEL Floor 1 Career Master):
  - Title: Senior Data Analyst
  - Skills: Python (4/5), SQL (5/5), System Design (2/5)
  - Proof points: QA overhaul, reporting infrastructure

Target State (from KERNEL Floor 5 Goal):
  - Title: Senior Data Engineer
  - Required: System Design (4/5), Cloud (3/5), Pipeline ownership

Gap:
  - System Design: +2 levels needed → need a lead project
  - Cloud: +3 levels needed → need hands-on infra work
  - Visibility: need 2 senior stakeholders aware of your trajectory

90-Day Sprint Plan:
  - Action 1: Volunteer to own the next pipeline migration (system design proof)
  - Action 2: Set up AWS free tier + complete one infra project (cloud proof)
  - Action 3: Request a skip-level with hiring manager (visibility)
```

### Step 3 — Build Stakeholder Maps from Floor 3

KERNEL Floor 3 (Networks) already contains relationship profiles. Pull them directly into the Advisor Stakeholder Map:

```markdown
## Stakeholder: [Skip-Level Manager Name]

**Role:** Director of Data Engineering
**Relationship to you:** Skip-level
**Influence level:** High — decision-maker on DE promotions
**Primary concern:** Pipeline reliability and team scalability
**Communication style:** Data-first, brief

**What they know about your work:** Aware of QA overhaul (mentioned in all-hands)
**What they should know:** That you led the pipeline migration scoping
**Next interaction goal:** They leave the 1:1 knowing you're building toward DE

**Relationship health:** Neutral → needs intentional development
**Last meaningful interaction:** All-hands Q3 2025
```

### Step 4 — Save Advisor Output Back to KERNEL Floor 4

Every Advisor session should produce a Floor 4 action file:

```markdown
## Project: Senior DE Promotion Sprint — Q1-Q2 2026

**Status:** Active
**Floor:** 4 — Action
**Last Updated:** February 2026

### Problem Statement
Gap between current Senior Analyst role and target Senior DE role requires
closing system design and cloud exposure gaps within 6 months.

### 90-Day Actions
- [ ] Own pipeline migration scoping — due March 15
- [ ] Complete AWS project — due March 31
- [ ] Skip-level meeting — schedule by Feb 28

### Blockers
- Need manager buy-in for pipeline migration ownership

### Next Open Question
Does the Director of DE already have a candidate in mind for the next opening?
```

## When to Use This Integration

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| Starting a new promotion push | Build Floor 1 Career Master first, then run Gap Analysis |
| Facing a career decision (stay/leave/pivot) | Run Advisor Decision Framework using Floor 1 + Floor 5 as inputs |
| Navigating a difficult stakeholder | Pull from Floor 3 Stakeholder Cards, apply Advisor Stakeholder Map |
| Quarterly planning | Update Floor 1 skills inventory, re-run Gap Analysis, update Floor 4 sprint |

---

## Integration with the Full Ecosystem

- **Add MEMORY** — Store your KERNEL documents in the AURELION Memory graph so Advisor sessions can retrieve your current state automatically across sessions.
- **Add AGENT** — Use AGENT's Trigger 2 (assumption check) during Gap Analysis to ensure your self-assessment is grounded in evidence, not wishful thinking.
